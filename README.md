# My solution for challenge "QR code component"

This is my first challenge in Frontend Mentor, I am starting out in frontend development, so to solve this challenge I only used HTML and CSS.

For the solution, start by building the HTML, to have the elements on the screen (image, first text and second text). I grouped these 3 elements on a card, the texts in a box, then aligned the elements inside the card and adjusted the external and internal margins.

The HTML elements used were `<div> - <h2> - <p>`
